Trump: We Must Realize the Full Potential of Women in Our Economy,"

;


During Fridays Weekly Address, President Donald Trump discussed the importance of women to the economy, saying he will deliver on his promise to help women in the workforce and ensuring they have equal access to the capital, markets and networks of support that they need.
Transcript as follows:
My fellow Americans, we have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my administration to remove wasteful regulations and get our people back to work. Ive been saying I was going to do that for a long time.
This week, I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continued to keep my promises to the American people, and so much more.
I signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an anti-coal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats. Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around, and were gonna turn it around quickly. We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal.
Thats why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd-Frank imposed on American energy companies. By stopping this regulation, we were able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job-killing compliance costs.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy. That is why I was thrilled to host the White Houses Women Business Leaders Roundtable. Very exciting. Great women.
As president, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets and networks of support that they need  and I mean really need. And its going to happen. This is a priority for my administration. I campaigned on helping women in the workforce and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me.
In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this week we announced the creation of the Joint United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting.
The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week with our cherished ally Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. I affirmed to the prime minister Americas commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability.
The threat of terrorism  and believe me it is a threat  must be confronted and defeated and we will defeat it. We share with Israel our deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life.
So as you head into Presidents Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf. We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants or pundits. We are here to work for you and only for you, the American people.
Thank you, God bless you and God bless America.

FAKE NEWS: CNBC Cites Left-Wing Politifact in Clinton Russian Uranium Story,"

;
CNBC cited the left-wing, George Soros-linkedPolitiFact to condemn President Donald Trumps claims Thursday that Hillary Clintons State Department presided over the sale of20 percent of U.S. uranium to Russia.
Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States; shes close to Russia, Trump saidduring the press conference.
The claim isnt true, CNBC energy reporterTom DiChristopher wrote. PolitiFact pointed out that 20 percent of uranium capacity is different from 20 percent of existing uranium. Moreover, the State Department was one of nine government agencies that had to sign off on the deals. Other federal and state regulators also had to approve them.
CNBC citing PolitiFact is how fake news spreads.

PolitiFact has repeatedly attempted to rewrite the facts surrounding theUranium One-Rosatom-Clinton State Department story firstreportedbyTheNew York Times(NYT)and based on research from theNYTbestsellerClinton Cash.
In July and in September 2016, PolitiFact published stories thatflat-out ignored severalkey facts and conflicts of interest that ultimately proved damaging to Clinton as it related to her involvement in the Russian uranium deal.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);DiChristopher notes that Clinton did not represent the State Department on the panel of agency officials who approve deals such as the Uranium One transaction, and rightly states: The representative at the time, former Assistant Secretary Jose Fernandez, told theTimes, Mrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any C.F.I.U.S. matter, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

But DiChristopher neglected to mention thatFernandez was admittedly politically motived to distance Clinton from the controversial uranium deal. DiChristopher also failed to report that Fernandez met with Clintons presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, and pledged to support the Democratic candidate.
On March 30, 2015,Fernandezwrote an email to Podestain hopes that the twocould meet.On April 17, Fernandezthanked Podesta for meetinghim and said, I would like to do all I can to support Secretary Clinton, and would welcome your advice and help in steering me to the right persons in the campaign.
Less than a week later, Fernandez was quoted byTime Magazinein an onlinestorycallingClinton Cashsreporting absurd conspiracy theories, adding, Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.

The coordination between Fernandez, the Clinton campaign, and its chairman John Podesta is undeniable  and yet CNBC didnt bother to mention that part of the story.
DiChristopher also failed to inform CNBC readers about how donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives ofRussian-ownedUranium One exceeded $145 million, according to theNew York Times. In fact, those Clinton Foundation donations spiked just as the deal for Russias Rosatom to secure Uranium One was being finalized.
Sure, Clintons State Department was one of eight agencies to review and sign off on the uranium deal  but then-Secretary of State Clinton was the only agency head whose family foundation received$145 million in donations from multiple people connected to the deal.

Uranium Ones chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million, the Timesreports.Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.
DiChristopher also failed to report that Bill Clinton received a $500,000 speaking fee for a speech in Moscow paid for by a Russian government-linked bank connected to the uranium deal.
And, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a half-million-dollar speakers fee, reports theNew Yorker.

"After 8 Years of Campaigner-in-Chief Obama, NPR Accuses Trump of Permanent Campaign","

;
After eightyears of Barack Obama putting his office into permanent campaign mode while keeping his campaign machinery in constant operation, NPR is accusingDonald J. Trump of waging a permanent campaign.
In a February 17 article, NPRs Ron Elving claimed that the American people are tired of presidential campaigns that last too long, but Now, they are confronted with one that refuses to end  even after reaching the White House.
Elvings attack on Trump came in response to the Presidents often combative February 15 press conference that the NPR Washington correspondent described with a simpleWow.
After notingthe criticism of the presser published by various news outlets, Elving then complained that Trump used I or me or the royal we too often during his presentation.

The NPR staffer then went on to say, The president often seemed to be responding in the manner of a candidate. He added, The campaign mode continues this weekend, with the president again rallying like its 2016.
Elving suggested that Trump might be being using this permanent campaign as a tactic to keep his policy ideas at the front of the political discussion.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Or perhaps the campaign continues because it continues, Elving said as he wrapped up. The president does not yet seem comfortable in his new office with all the crosswinds and complications of divided powers and shared responsibilities.

PerhapsElving has been in a coma since 2007, when Obama launched a campaign for president that didnt end until he left office on January 20, 2017. Obama spent eight years being hit with charges that he never stopped campaigning, It was one of the most common criticisms of the Obama presidency.
In fact, Obama kept his campaign apparatus, Organizing for America, in operationeven after what he claimed would be his last election. In December of 2012, for instance,The Observer remarkedthat OFA was still soliciting contributions months after Obama won his second term.
Indeed, OFA is up and running today, aiming to undermine Donald Trump and many are making noteof it.Obamacontinues to issue tweets using the OFA Twitter account,and gives marching orders to his OFA army, even in reputed retirement.

In August of 2009, former George W. Bush political advisor Karl Rove charged that Obama was continuing to use divisive, and permanent campaign tactics despiteeasily winning his election. The Washington Timesobserved the same thing.
The claim was not made only by disgruntled conservatives or center-right news sources, either.
In 2013 The New York Times wrote that Obamas campaign without end was fundraising in an unprecedented manner.

Before that, the Washington Posts Dana Milbank commented on the issue in May of 2012, saying that Obama had embraced the permanent campaign and was flying all across the country leading campaign-style rallies to push his agenda.
To a greater extent than his predecessors, Obama has used the trappings of his office to promote his reelection prospects even while handling taxpayer-funded business, Milbank wrote.
In addition, several left-wing websites and commentators actually celebrated Obama for using campaign tactics to continue to sell his ideas. MSNBC praised Obama for putting the permanent campaign to good use, and The Atlantic marveled that Obamas permanent campaign was using his reelection playbook to change Washington.
With all this, it is interesting that today NPRs Ron Elving seems to have only just noticed that a president is perpetrating a permanent campaign to keep his policieson track to completion.
Finally, it was rathertone deaf for Elving to criticize Donald Trump for using I and me too much, coming off the last eight years ofa president famous for his narcissistic references to himself in every appearance. Despite mocking the penchant of the center-right press for keeping count of his self-referential habits, The Washington Post recently published a piecenoting just how often Obama talked about himself.
After all, Barack Obama was the president so enthralled with himself that he gave the Queen of England the dubious gift of an iPod filled with Barack Obama speeches.

"Former Obama Aide Fined $90,000 for Unethical Lobbying for Uber","

;
David Plouffe, Barack Obamas 2008 campaign manager,was fined $90,000 by the Chicago Board of Ethics in a 5-0 vote for improperlylobbying Mayor Rahm Emanuel on behalf of Uber Technologies.
The San Francisco resident was fined $1,000 a day for the 90 days he used personal email accounts without being a registered lobbyist to lobby Mayor Emanuel, former Chief of Staff to President Barack Obama, to allow Uber to make unlimited ride-share pick-ups at Chicagos Midway and OHare airports. Plouffe and Emanuel had worked together during Obamas first campaign.
The City of Chicago had operated a lucrative business auctioning off taxi cab medallions for a minimum of $360,000 per medallion. That explained why the base fare for a Chicago taxi ride was $ 3.25 for the first mile and $ 2.25 for each additional mile. The added medallion cost also explained why the fare for a taxi cab ride from the downtown Chicago Loop to OHare was $36, plus tip, compared to just $28 for the same passenger to take an Uber ride.
After Mayor Emanuel announced that he was authorizing Uber and Lyft to make trips formerly restricted to cab -nly pickups at OHare and Midway, as well asat the McCormick Place convention center, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) called a strike of Chicagos 12,000 taxi drivers on October 6, 2015. The union wanted to stop ride ride-sharing, or force Uber to pay a $5 surcharge to the City to level the cost with taxis, according to the CBS local affiliate.

Community Digital News (CDN) had been reporting that Rahm Emanuel had a family conflict regarding ride-sharing in Chicago, because his brother Ari Emanuelhad a financial interest in the company.
As a vice president of policy and strategy for Uber, Plouffe began communicating on behalf of Uber through the mayors personal email accounts. Plouffe was concerned about the surcharge fee and the city requirement that the Uber vehicles that make airport pickups would be required to include signs designating those vehicles had paid the fee.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);CDN reported that beginning November 25, 2015, Plouffe sent the following emails to Emanuel:

Assume both of us thought the airport issue was settled and we would never have to discuss again, but unfortunately two significant new hurdles were introduced.
Coming to you because of their severity that would prevent us from operating. We were all set to announce Monday we were beginning pickups.
Sure this comes as much of a surprise to you as us, since there was an agreement in place.

Emanuel was traveling and referred Plouffe to a pair of his top aides, but the private email chains were subsequently released when Emanuel settled a lawsuit filed by the Better Government Association. That caused the Board of Ethics to cross-check the names of those using the mayors private accounts to lobby for administrative or legislative action to see if they were registered as lobbyists.
Plouffe is one of about 30 individuals that the ethics board has designated as using Rahm Emanuels personal emails to lobby him regarding city issues. The Chicago Board of Ethics chairman William Conlon responded to the Chicago Sun Times questions about individuals other than Plouffe others being fined by stating, It is the only fine we have publicly announced, hinting there will be more parties fined.

NYT: Bill Maher and Milo Yiannopoulos Find Common Ground,"

;
The New York Times reports Breitbart Senior Editor MILO and Bill Maher agreed on many issues while appearing on HBOs Real Time With Bill Maher.
Describing MILOs appearance on the show, the New York Times writes, Despite a brief flare-up of controversy that preceded it, a conversation between Milo Yiannopoulos, the incendiary right-wing author and lecturer, and Bill Maher, the comedian and host of HBOs Real Time, on that program Friday night was a largely docile, chummy affair. There was little conflict or cross-examination, as both men chided the political left for avoiding or drowning out Mr. Yiannopouloss views rather than engaging with them.
Introducing Mr. Yiannopoulos, 32, an openly gay editor at Breitbart News, Mr. Maher said: I think youre colossally wrong on a number of things. But if I banned everyone from my show who I thought was colossally wrong, I would be talking to myself,' theNYT noted.
Quoting MILO, the NYT states: All I care about is free speech and free expression, Mr. Yiannopoulos explained. I want people to be able to be, do and say anything. These days, youre right, thats a conservative issue.

The NYT mentioned MILOs observations of the political lefts inability to understand comedy anymore: In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as the party of Lena Dunham, the creator and star of Girls. (Mr. Maher replied: Lets not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people.)
Ending the article by discussing MILOs comments on Overtime, Mahers internet streamed after-show program, the NYT stated, Trying to defuse the tension [between the panelists], Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldnt be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. This is the beginning of your career, Mr. Maher said. People are only just starting to hate you.

"Larry Wilmore Melts Down, Tells MILO Go F*ck Yourself","

;
Left-wing comedian Larry Wilmore had a meltdownduring MILOs appearance on Overtime, the online segment of Real TimeWith Bill Maher, eventually telling MILO to go f*** yourself.

Following a heated discussion about the discrimination of homosexuals in society, MILO suggested to Bill Maher that he invited guests with higher IQs onto the show.
Wilmore, visibly infuriated by MILOs comments, said hang on a second, you can go f*** yourself alright, to rapturous applause and squealing from Mahers audience.

Your argument is that these people are stupid, you didnt hear a word what this man said earlier in this segment because he can talk circles around your pathetic, douchey little ass, he continued.
Wilmore then challenged MILOs theory thatGhostbustersactress Leslie Jones isbarely literate.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);Leslie Jones is not barely litterate, you can go f*** yourself again for that one, Wilmore said. Shes a very thoughtful person and very funny.

Why is the goofy white boy coming thru!! The announcers won't even call him lebron. The jamesing like a Muthafucka! Wake up James!!
 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) June 3, 2016

You should check her twitter feed, she can barely spell, MILO responded.
Despite not receiving support from Mahers left-wing audience, Georgian Congressman Jack Kingston did come to MILOs defense.

Larry, Im a great fan of yours man, but we are all about the First Amendment here and MILO, go for it brother, because I think what they did you to in Berkeley was atrocious.
