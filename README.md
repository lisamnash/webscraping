# Webscraping of Breitbart (and maybe other conservative/liberal outlets later)

I'm scraping Breitbart for featured article urls ('article_urls.py'). 'breitbart_scrape.py' takes breitbart urls as inputs and will save the article title and article text.

The plan is to do some kind of analysis on this stuff later (Natural Language Processing?)
