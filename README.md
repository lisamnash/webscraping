# Webscraping of Breitbart and Slate

This is a not super creative first try at webscraping and language processing.  I plan to scrape the top articles on slate (liberal) and Breitbart (conservative) and see if I can find measureable differences between them.  I know pretty much nothing about NLP at this point, so this should be fun I guess.

Note: not comparing the legitimacy of these two sources at all.
