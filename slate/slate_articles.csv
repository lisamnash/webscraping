The false promise of sanctuary cities.,""":""In the wake of President Trumps nativist crackdown, mayors in left-leaning cities have defiantly proclaimed that their cities will remain sanctuaries where immigrants can find refuge. The definition of a sanctuary city is somewhat murky: At minimum, it is a locality that wont hold suspects for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or allow their police officers or sheriffs deputies to do the work of federal immigration agents. But for many immigrants, such protections mean nothing at all. Its not just tough-on-crime Republicans that preside over a criminal justice system that today serves as the front door for a massive deportation pipeline. Every day, police and prosecutors in Democratic Partycontrolled cities fuel mass incarceration by arresting and charging people for low-level nonviolent offenses. An arrest for jumping a turnstile or a minor drug charge could result in a persons separation from his or her family forever. America is the most incarceratory nation in the worldin 2015 alone, police made an estimated 11 million arrests. For undocumented immigrants, an arrest can trigger detention and deportation by ICE. And thats true even if a self-described sanctuary city refuses to detain someone upon federal request. The fingerprints police collect when booking someone into custody are automatically shared with federal immigration authorities, whether that police department wants to share them or not. A fingerprint match alerts ICE that a suspected undocumented immigrant has been arrested. ICE agents can then find that person, detain them, and deport them. If ICE wants to detain someone, they can find and detain them anywhere in the United States regardless of whether local officials are cooperating. Now, under Trump, a man who has declared that the Mexican government is coordinating the mass migration of rapists to the United States and that Muslims pose an existential threat to the West, things could get far worse. On Friday morning, the Associated Press reported the existence of a draft memo that indicates the Trump administration is considering the unprecedented step of deploying 100,000 National Guard troops to perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States. As of last year, ICE employed roughly 5,800 deportation officers. (The White House has denied it is considering such a policy but did not deny the existence of such a memo.) With more boots on the ground, the imperative for local criminal justice officials is clearer than ever. As long as police and prosecutors continue to arrest and charge people for low-level offenses, sanctuary cities simply arent safe for undocumented immigrants. Recently, the administration began an end run around self-proclaimed sanctuary cities. In Travis County, Texaswhich includes Austin, the states liberal meccaSheriff Sally Hernandez promised recently to ignore most ICE detainers or requests to detain an immigrant. But according to a news report last week, immigration officials obtained federal arrest warrants for at least 42 immigrants, charging most with federal felonies for illegally re-entering the United States. By using judicial arrest warrants instead of detainers, ICE is now requiring rather than requesting that immigrants be detainedand Hernandez was thus compelled to turn them over to the feds. ICE also identifies, detains, and deports immigrants after they have been convicted of a crime, including very minor ones. Even lawful permanent residents who have spent their entire cognizant lives in the United States can be deported as the result of a minor drug-dealing conviction. For undocumented immigrants, incarceration in state prison will also tip off the feds: If youre locked up, theyll know exactly where to find you. Harsh and inhumane federal immigration laws are, of course, the fault of the federal government. But as long as local law enforcement shares information with ICE, everyday policing and prosecution are complicit in Trumps crackdown. For decades, mainstream Republicans and Democrats have turned local criminal justice systems into the grease that smooths the federal deportation machines operation. It was legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996 that made it so easy to deport lawful permanent residents for minor crimes. And it was the Secure Communities program initiated under President George W. Bush and rolled out under President Obama that has rendered local police de facto immigration agents and made it virtually impossible for states or localities to opt out. Trump undoubtedly poses a historic threat to immigrants. But local elected officials and prosecutors cannot just shrug their shoulders and blame mass deportations on Washington politicians. Local district attorneys are responsible for the vast majority of prosecutions that result in incarceration. These local prosecutors must also take responsibility for the massive deportation campaign that Trump has pledged to undertake. Simply ignoring federal detainer requests isnt enough to make a city a real sanctuary. Sanctuary cities were a critical victory won by activists. They were implemented because outraged immigrant communitieswith assistance from federal courts that found detentions raised serious constitutional issuessuccessfully pressured cities to refuse to cooperate with federal detainer requests. In Washington, that pressure led Obama, who had carried out mass deportations, to more narrowly define which immigrants would be prioritized for removal, amongst other reforms. But Obama left the programs basic information-sharing architecture in place and ready for full deployment by the most nativist administration in recent U.S. history. Purportedly progressive mayors are offering immigrants a false sense of security. The reality is that sanctuary cities are not doing enough to mitigate the immigration threat that Trump poses. The only reason that Secure Communities works is because it affixed the deportation pipeline to the largest policing and imprisonment system on Earth. Cities can and must shrink their contribution to that system by arresting and prosecuting fewer people. While localities cant end drug prohibition, they can pull back from fighting the drug war by ceasing to arrest and prosecute people for drug possession and minor drug-dealing offenses. Prosecutors and police dont make laws, but they have the power of discretion."","""
Trumps chaos has real consequences for everyone.,""":""In the latest in a series of deranged moves against the press, the White House denied on Friday that the administration was contemplating mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants around the country. The denial was launched in response to an Associated Press report published earlier on Friday that stated this had been consideredand cited a leaked draft of a White House memo as evidence. While the White House had declined to comment for the AP story, once it was released, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer fired back: There is no effort at all to ... utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants, he said. This is 100 percent not true. Weird. So why wouldnt the White House have just told the AP that on Thursday or Friday and put the whole story to rest? Well, likely because Spicers denial isnt as comprehensive as it sounds. Understanding what he actually means seems to require parsing the definition of the word is. In this case, it sounds like Spicer probably meant is in the traditional Bill Clinton sense of that word. As in maybe this action was being considered before, but currently it is not. But also it might be again. Or not. Answering the question this way allows Spicer to deny a negative true story while also technically not lying about it. This seems to be the likeliest scenario at this point but until he answers a question about whether or not the memo was ever really in play, we just wont know. The best evidence for this theory is in a report by Bloomberg: A Homeland Security Department official who insisted on anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the memo was an early idea that was never seriously considered. So it was an idea, but now it is not. Spicer wasnt lying as long as you use the right is. Whether the National Guard will be used to enforce Trumps deportation plans is beside the point right now. What matters is how the White House responded to this story: It refused to answer when it was being reported and then trashed the ultimate report as 100 percent not true after it came out. The purpose of that reaction is simple. It pushes the White Houses main narrative: that the press are peddling fake news; that the administration is rife with treacherous leakers; that everyone in the media and in government is conspiring to make Donald Trump look bad; and that the only person who can be trusted to tell the truth is the president himself. If the White House had actually wanted to offer clarity on its plans or make people aware that it wasnt planning to create a terrifying mass deportation force, the solution would have been simple: They could have simply denied the report on Thursday when the AP sought comment or explained that the proposal was never seriously considered. But the benefits of further delegitimizing the media and any dissenters inside the administration far outweigh any potential upsides of clear communication. Instead, this method builds on what Trumps press conference and media survey qua fundraiser accomplished on Thursday: Attack the group Trump sees as his principal adversary. Heres what else the White House gains from this informational vacuum: The leaked story further terrorizes immigrant communities that are already reeling from reports of sweeps and roundups. It also further emboldens Immigration and Customs Enforcement (and Customs and Border Patrol) agents who are being told that they answer to nobody but the president. It assures Trumps base, albeit through a proposal the administration denies is being considered, that illegals are going to be dealt with brutally. And it sets up a convenient potential fight with the judicial branch down the road. We are long past the point where we can impute logic or cunning to such moves. Better to suspect that this story, like the disastrous implementation of the executive order travel ban, has as much (or more) to do with incompetence and interagency miscommunication as it does with a master plan. And whichever it was, the result is the same: These actions continue to serve the single uber-agenda Trump lovesdeclaring loudly that the press is the enemy and that leakers are going down. That it also distracts from the ongoing war against the environment, womens rights, workers, and baby bears now taking place on Capitol Hill is just a cherry on top. Emoluments violations are piling up like beer cans on a frat house lawn. The media is made to attempt to chase down what may or may not be fake news because it may or may not be true. It is chaos. But whether it is intentional or incompetence does not matter: We all need to stop berating the media for being endlessly distracted. Instead, we should be aware of the effects the chaos has. One real effect of Spicers failure to reply to the AP is that immigrants may now be more afraid. That matters. Another is that it emboldens ICE to continue its harsh treatment of immigrants. And finally, Spicers evade-then-berate act undermines the credibility of the press. That matters, too. Without the press acting as watchdogs, looting the public coffers and preying on the weak is exponentially simpler. The media loses by reporting the real story and getting chastised for it. And we all lose if the media doesnt report the real story, because that lets the White House get away with mounting evidence of corruption, incompetence, and cruelty. And none of us can afford that."","""
The Republican plan to replace Obamacare includes a giant assault on abortion.,""":""In an attempt to project some semblance of party unity and momentum, House Speaker Paul Ryanunveiled the latest Republican roadmap for replacing the Affordable Care Act this week. It is not the most detailed documentmore a collection of broad-stroke ideas than a concrete policy planand it's unclear how much support it would find in Congress. But at least one thing is obvious from this outline: Republicans are looking to turn Obamacare repeal into an assault on abortion access. Here's how they'd go about it: To make health insurance (somewhat) affordable, Ryan's plan would offer tax credits to all Americans purchasing coverage on the individual market. However, women would not be allowed to use those subsidies to buy plans that paid for aboration. Given that the vast majority of customers would want to use their tax credits, most carriers would likely drop abortion coverage from their offerings. It seems pretty clear that this would drastically scale back or possibly eliminate abortion coverage in the individual market, Adam Sonfield, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, told me. He added that the rule could also have spillover effects on employer-based insurance, because of the way the Republican idea could affect COBRA coverage. Reproductive health advocates faced down a similar threat when Congress was crafting Obamacare in 2010. Back then, the House of Representatives passed the notorious Stupak amendment, which would have banned Americans from using the ACA's tax credits to buy coverage that included abortion benefits. The worry then was that if insurers couldn't sell subsidized plans that covered abortion, they wouldn't bother selling any. One analysis from the George Washington University School of Public Health suggested that would spark an industry-wide change in standards that would end coverage of medically necessary abortions for all women, not only those whose coverage is derived through a health insurance exchange. Before Obamacare became law, however, the Stupak amendment was subbed out for a watered-down replacement proposed by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. The map of abortion coverage under the ACA is complicated. Thanks to the Hyde amendment, which prevents federal money from being used to fund abortions, Medicaid can't cover abortion anywhere. Meanwhile, 25 states currently restrict or ban insurance plans sold on Obamacare's insurance exchanges from covering abortion, according to Guttmacher. Ten states limit it on all private insurance plans. But in others there are no restrictions on abortion benefits in the private market at all. The new Republican plan is a bit like the Stupak amendment on steroids. After all, Obamacare's subsidies are only eligible to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty line. The Republican tax credit would be available to anybody in the individual market, meaning insurers would likely expect pretty much everyone to use one, and tailor their offerings accordingly. (For those wondering: No, Ryan has not said how much the credits would be worth, and since they'd be universal, they'd also likely be pretty small.) You would expect abortion coverage to disappear from the whole individual market rapidly. Like the GW team argued years ago, it's possible that the change in industry norms would lead insurers to drop the benefits from the plans they sell to employers. Some might suggest that women could purchase special riders to cover abortion, but those sorts of add-ons haven't worked particularly well in health insurance, since they tend to be extremely expensive. It's hard to quantify how deeply the GOP plan would damage abortion access. Even when women do have private insurance coverage, most of them end up paying out of pocket [for abortions]. What is not clear is why, Sonfield told me. However, driving abortion coverage out of the individual market would certainly make the procedure less affordable for many, while further stigmatizing a procedure that should be considered a standard part of reproductive care. Of course, that might be the only part of health reform every Republican will be able to get behind."","""
"Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Meyers tried to make sense of Trump's press conference.",""":""Our show tapes at 6:30, Seth Meyers explained as he began his A Closer Look segment on Thursday night. Usually, we start writing A Closer Look the night before; by 1:00 p.m. today, we had a draft about Republicans attempts to repeal Obamacare that we felt good about. And then Donald Trump held what can only be described as a batshit crazy press conference. Heres Stephen Colbert making sense of Thursdays horrifying events on the fly, to begin The Late Show: I am your host Stephen Colbert, and wow. I am glad you could be here on this historic evening, because Donald Trump held his first solo press conference as president . It just happened, actually. Were recording this in the early afternoon. It literally just finished. What Im saying is this is fresh. It must be fresh because you can smell it. And heres a very grim, troubled Trevor Noah, echoing Meyers claims of a rewrite: We had a really nice show planned for you. Very civil, very calm. And then, in the middle of the day, Hurricane Trump happenedagain. Donald Trumps bizarre, winding, frighteningly erratic press conference on Thursday had late-night comics scrambling as to adequately make sense of it. The amount of remarkable detailsTrumps All Black People Must Be Friends comment, his repeated lie about the size and historical significance of his victory, his stunning attacks on the media, his contradictory comments regarding real leaks and fake news and whether his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn did anything wrong, his demand that a Jewish reporter expressing concern about an uptick in anti-semitism sit down and be quiet, and on and onrendered any cogent summation impossible. Noah and Meyers teams cut together highlight reels, making clear just how unsettling the whole charade was, while Colbert turned to news anchors bewildered, and in most cases disturbed, reactions. Words fail me, as Colbert admitted. Noah probably came closest to capturing the essence of what we all bore witness to on Thursday, in channeling Trumps performance: Im not drunk. Youre all drunk. Youre all drunk. This my motherfucking house. This my motherfucking house. Goony goo-goo. Goony goo-goo. Enough said."","""
"Even in 2016, Democrats Carried Rust Belt Town Centers. Why?",""":""Back in early November (such a simple time!), I wrote a piece for Slate on political scientist Jonathan Roddens analysis of precinct-level voting patterns.Rodden, a professor at Stanford, showed that the familiar pattern of high-density Democratic areas and low-density Republican areas had been re-created, fractal-like, in the small towns and cities of the Rust Belt during Barack Obamas presidential election in 2008. These little-downtown voters, who helped Obama carry several swing states, were supposed to be irrelevant to the Democratic Party in 2016, as Chuck Schumer infamously said in July:For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. After Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania flipped for Trump on Nov. 8, it was easy to think that small-town Democrats had abandoned the party wholesale. But it turns out Democrats didnt lose those town cores inPennsylvania and Ohio; in fact, as Rodden showed with new data this week in the Washington Post, the correlation between living downtown and votingDemocrat was (relative to nearby rural areas) just as strong in this presidential election as in its predecessors. Red counties werent homogenous before, and theyre not homogenous now. Rodden thinks this trend rebuts a common cultural trope about small-town America: \""A popular claim is that Trumps populist anti-trade rhetoric resonated most in postindustrial towns with severe job losses, he writes in the Post. \""If so, we might expect that these towns suddenly started to vote more like their neighboring Republican precincts, with the graphs flattening in 2016. In fact, his graphs show two things: First,Clinton did worse across the board in all these countiesthanAl Gore, John Kerry, and Obama (both times). Second, her returns mirrored almost exactly the existing correlation betweenpopulation density and politics.People who lived closer to downtown were still more likely to vote Dem. Im not sure Rodden is right to characterizethe downtowns of Ashtabula, Ohio, and Muncie, Indiana, (among other places) as more stung byindustrial job loss than their outskirts. They were once. ButJohnUpdikes America, whereHarry Angstrom could take the bus home from his job as a linotype operator, is a long time gone. Manufacturing work has taken place outside of downtownfor manydecades.The top four small metro areas for job sprawl, according to a 2009 Brookings analysis, were all post-industrial Northeast cities: Poughkeepsie, New York; Scranton and Wilkes-Barre in Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Worcester, Massachusetts. In Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, for example, more than half of all jobs are more than 10 miles from the two cities downtowns. Thats not new. So when the plant closes, it shouldnt burn downtown voters more than others. Still, whatever voters grievances about deindustrialization, there are other correlations that would tip these old town centersScranton, Wilkes-Barre, Reading,and Johnstown, in Pennsylvania, for exampletoward Democrats. For one thing, they are almost all poorer than theirsuburbs. For another, they all have concentrated minority populations. They also have more rental housing, and their residents ought to have a closer relationship to the public assets that Democrats have traditionallychampioned, like universities, libraries, parks, and transit. For Democrats, the problemwith these people isnt that they didnt vote Democratic; its that they didnt vote at all. In some cases, turnout in downtown precincts was about half what it was a few miles away. Clinton still carried them. This, then, is an optimistic message about left-wing politics in non-metropolitan America: Those deep-red swaths of countryside in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana are more politically diverse than they look. It just depends on your frame of reference."","""
James Mann on why Michael Flynn flamed out faster than expected.,""":""The resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn this week was a stunning development, even for an administration that has generated more chaos and upheaval than Washington has ever seen in the early weeks of a presidency. With breaking news arriving nearly every hour, and with American foreign policy in an uncertain state, I spoke on the phone with James Mann, a journalist, expert on foreign affairs, and author of The Obamians: The Struggle Inside the White House to Redefine American Power. During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed what made Flynn such a unique national security adviser, whether the deep state is trying to undermine Trump, and the most boring part of the presidents job. Isaac Chotiner: You wrote a piece for the New York Times in December arguing that Trumps foreign policy team was built to fail. What has surprised even you about the past month? James Mann: I have been surprised by the intensity of the fights over Flynn, and I have been surprised at what it produced within the administration, which is to say: intense skirmishing among high-level people at the White House. To be self-critical about that piece, probably what I had more in mind and sketched out was a clash between Flynn and the secretary of defense, James Mattis. How different was Flynns brief tenure compared with people who have held his job? Usually what happens is that a president-elect, early on, designates a national security adviser who then begins a fairly orderly process of putting together a staff. And actually, Flynn followed some of these precedents, staffing out a National Security Council. It was different in that it was heavily dominated by people from the military. But there were also three things that were different about Flynn. The first was an intense regional focus on the Middle East and ISIS and terrorism. Flynn had no particular experience in dealing with other parts of American foreign policy or national security. Lets remember that Flynns development of ties with Russia came from his efforts to work with Russia on the Middle East. Even Russia was seen through a Middle Eastern focus. That is very unusual, for a national security adviser to be that focused in a way that everything else is seen through that lens. He has Muslims on the brain. Yes. [Laughs.] The second was a bureaucratic animus. He had it in for the regular intelligence community. Whatever grievances he had, he wore them on his sleeve. There were two different grievances. One was in favor of the guys in field versus the people in Washington, and the other grievance was against the CIA. Those are old fights, and a national security adviser doesnt usually bring those to his new job. The third is the matter of temperament, which isnt totally unrelated to the bureaucratic animus. This is a guy who exuded anger in a way that past national security advisers didnt. And fourth, I would add, is an almost cheerleader quality for the president-elect. There is really no precedent I can think of for a national security adviser having stood up at a political convention and suggesting that the opposing candidate should be locked up. One of the surprises is that all of this is taking place without all that much input from the secretaries of state and defense. This is really a very narrow bureaucratic battle in which two or three of the leading figures in the bureaucracy seem to play little of a role. What I am used to, much more often, is a full-scale, all-out war between the leading Cabinet secretaries, which was true in the Reagan administration and under George W. Bush. Or a battle between the national security and the online policy makers. What do you mean by that? Meaning the people carrying out the policy with China or Russia day to day. Whats amazing is that Flynn never got to the questions that should have hit him about how operational he should beshould he be in what is normally called the Brent Scowcroft model, where the national security adviser is sort of the arbiter? As an aside, even Scowcroft didnt follow that model, but it is the ideal that often gets put out there. When have national security advisers departed from that ideal? The first national security adviser to really break that mold was [Henry] Kissinger. In my mind, the single moment that was the most humiliating that you could possibly imagine for a secretary of state came as Kissinger was leaving on his secret trip to China, and they hadnt even told Secretary of State [William] Rogers that he was going. First they told him a lie, which was that this came up quickly as he was leaving for Pakistan. Then someone felt guilty, and they sent Kissingers deputy, who was Alexander Haig, to inform Rogers that, oh yeah, Kissinger has been negotiating with the Chinese, and has also been conducting secret talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris, and talks on arms control. Were you surprised by the amount of opposition Flynn and the president have faced from the bureaucracy? I guess I am not all that surprised. It would be one thing if Trump was just trying to change policy, but he is trying to change policy while belittling the motives and sincerity and patriotism of everyone before him. Flynn and Trump were impugning the motives of the entire U.S. intelligence community, and in the case of Flynn, he was telling untruths, which people in the intelligence community had access to. And they had legitimate access to it. I cant believe the back-and-forth about monitoring these phone conversations. They werent monitoring Flynn; they were monitoring the Russian ambassador. And above all, you had the perception that Flynns untruths might be, in the view of some in the intelligence community, betraying the interests of the United States to an adversary. Does the extent of the leaks worry you? People are using phrases like deep-state coup. I find those fears overblown. This is a unique case in which someone at the level of the national security adviser was saying things that were not true about his conversations with the government of one of the United States two leading adversaries in the world. The fact that people within the bureaucracy wanted to come outI dont see that as all that worrisome. I certainly dont see it as something like a deep-state coup, in your words. How likely is it that Trump will make a major effort to staff multiple levels of the bureaucracy with allies, and how possible is that for him to pull off? I think he is going to try. I think that is possible, if he is willing to find people who are willing to deal with Congress and the press and other governments in something other than an angry andconspiratorial way. Anything lower down requires experience with policy areas, whether its a country or region or an area like proliferation or counterterrorism. Most of the people in those policy areas have a body of knowledge, which Trump seems to mistrust. If there is a resentment of all expertise, then it is hard to get experts. Why cant he staff these positions with Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon types? The problem is that those nonexperts are going to have trouble winning support from the congressional committees, which know a little bit about the areas they are working on; from foreign governments that may know about the Middle East or Asia a little more; from journalists who cover particular areas. You wont have a policy if you dont have people who can draw up a policy. Along the lines of what you were saying earlier, its interesting that the person tapped to be the next national security adviser, Robert Harward, is supposed to be very close to Mattis. Exactly, yes. Maybe things will start running more smoothly. It could hardly run less smoothly. Let me add on that: By the natural order of things, foreign policy is still moving forward. It has to. Like with [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abes visit last weekend, you can envision a scenariomaybe for good reasons, more likely for ego reasonswhere Trump begins to like having foreign leaders come either as supplicants or bringing money and investment. He might get into at least the summit aspect of it. You can envision things settling down and that he might somehow get some pleasure out of the routine aspects of high-level diplomacy. On the other side of that, and I have heard this from Obama officials and in general, a good part of a presidents job is going to high-level multilateral meetings. There is a wonderful anecdote where during the Trump-Obama meeting, Obama just said he was going to go to APEC [the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum], and Trump asked what it was. Obama described it, and Trump said, That sounds boring. And in fact some of those meetings are. Obama himself used to get annoyed at some of those meetings he had to sit through, with four hours of speeches, while his top aides went off into bilateral meetings on topics that might be more interesting. He would be left there. Its not clear to me how [Trump] is going to get out of those, but I dont see him sitting through long meetings. But I can see him enjoying, eventually, well, I dont know. None of us really know, unfortunately. [Laughs.] Yeah."","""
"The Salt Lake Screaming Eagles, a football team controlled by fans with smartphones. ",""":""In a drafty arena on the outskirts of Salt Lake City, near the end of a full-pads training camp practice for an expansion, eight-on-eight indoor football team, I think I may have witnessed the future of sports. It wasnt a 470-pound tight end with a 9-foot vertical and a 3.2 40, or a genius new spread formation that aligns the center behind the tailback. It was just a few dudes with an app and a dream who, if all goes to plan, could fuse the gap between live sports, massive multiplayer videogames, and fantasy geek analytics. They are the minds behind the Salt Lake Screaming Eaglesthe newest franchise in the 10-team Indoor Football League, where tickets start at $5 and players make $250 a gameand theyre embarking on the first steps of a seasonlong experiment in what is being termed interactive football. A couple weeks ago, a few rows up in the near-deserted stands of the Maverik Centera minor-league hockey rink where the Screaming Eagles will play their home gamesI watched a dozen or so nonathletic folks in jeans and parkas thumb their iPhones and Android devices. Theyd been waiting for a scrimmage at the close of practice to run a live beta test, and now showtime had arrived. OK, pick your play! shouted a man in a hoodie sitting in the hockey penalty box, glancing at a laptop screen. Using the play-calling function on the Screaming Eagles mobile app, this test groupcomprising team owners, employees, and a few palsscrolled through diagrammed play selections, not unlike the kind youd see while playing a Madden NFL video game. Each voted for his or her favorite run or pass. Meanwhile, down on the sideline, the Screaming Eagles burly, bearded head coach stared at a separate laptop, impatiently awaiting the results. Once the leading vote-getter locked in (in this maiden effort, the winning play was a simple curl route), the coach barked the call to his quarterback as the 25-second play clock ticked. The QB broke the huddle, sprinted to the line of scrimmage, andhaving been issued marching orders by the people in the seatscompleted a curl to a receiver who was tackled for a short gain. Not much to look at, footballwise. The players still seemed wary. But shouts and cheers exploded from the stands, with phones raised triumphantly in the air. Then noses immediately returned to screens. No time to gloatthe coach and QB were antsy, peering upward, waiting for the fans next call as the play clock ticked down again. It didnt take long before the Screaming Eagles offense had driven the length of the fieldin the IFL, its just 50 yards from end zone to end zoneand punched the ball in for a touchdown. I voted for that play! laughed a hefty guy in a baseball hat. That was my play! You called that? Great call! shouted one of the Screaming Eagles players, pointing up into the seats. Sohrob Farudi, the teams majority owner, looked on with a wide, almost disbelieving grin. This is exactly what we wanted, he marveled. The players thanking the fans for calling their number! This is just how we dreamt it. * * * Farudi is a 39-year-old Los Angeles entrepreneur who, back in 2011, sold a company called Flipswap that hed built around a real-time pricing engine for used mobile phones. Although he didnt clear enough to fulfill his childhood dream of buying the Cowboys, in 2014 he did become a minority owner of the Arena Football Leagues Las Vegas Outlaws. That was the worst experience of my life, he says now. His six-figure investment resulted in a still-ongoing lawsuit and a bitter public feud with co-investor Vince Neilbetter known as the bleach-tressed lead vocalist of hair-metal rockers Mtley Cre. The Outlaws went kaput after a single season. Farudi vowed to try football ownership again, but this time he had a far bolder idea in mind. He longed to wed sports with mobile technology to somehow create a team that was completely interactiverun entirely by its fans. He found a few other folks entranced by the idea, formed an ownership group, and went hunting for a team to mess with. They settled on the IFL, which had been formed in 2008, because it let them start with a blank slate by buying the right to launch an expansion franchise. And so, in October 2015, Farudis group plunked down the $75,000 fee. And the wackadoo experimentation began. When Farudi said he wanted the franchise to be run entirely by its fans, he meant that he wanted the franchise to be run entirely by its fans. He started by putting the new teams geographic location up for a vote. Both Oklahoma City and Salt Lake were viable options, hed determined, so he put up a poll on the teams website. Once Salt Lake won, he asked the public to bestow a nickname on the team. About 36,000 votes came in, with Screaming Eagles beating out options like Teamy McTeamface and Spaghetti Monsters. Farudi says he was actually disappointed in the conservatism of the online hordes. He was rooting for a more offbeat choice to win because it would garner easy publicity, plus offer early proof that hed respect the fans wishes no matter how unconventional. Farudis a bit unconventional himself. His main business ventures currently include a wholesale marijuana edibles startup and an outfit that sells specialty cooking charcoal to restaurants. Hes young and clever, bored by the thought of running a regular old team, and absolutely tickled by the notion of introducing something wholly new to the world of sports. Guided by his thirst for novelty, he kept pushing forward, searching for more things that fans could vote on. Screaming Eagles partisans chose the head coach, based on a selection of rsums and some interviews the team uploaded to YouTube. Fans chose a portion of the players on the roster, based on college stats and footage from training camp practices. For a small fee, Farudi let folks dial into a weekly conference call, giving input directly to the teams president as virtual general managers. But his driving vision has always been to let the fans call plays. Farudi didnt want this to be a one-time gimmick, like voting on whether to receive or defer on the coin flip or letting a local celebrity call pass or run on the first snap after kickoff.

Everything was fair game. Farudi was convinced he could make it work, technologywise. Certainly the fans in the arena could watch the game live and make quick play selections on their phones, choosing between a few tailored options. In the training camp session I watched, spectators got 15 seconds to lock in their picks, which left 10 seconds on the play clock for the offense to get to the line and hike.

Otherwise an opponents defensive coordinator could simply look at his phone and know what play was coming. Its true he could see which options were on the table for fans to vote on, but these would include enough variation to keep him guessing. Perhaps the greater danger would be opposing fans hacking the process. What if they ganged up to click the Eagles into suboptimal play calls?

Hes a huge, bald, bearded guy, radiating toughness. Yet to watch McCarthy on the sideline is to observe a man who vacillates, moment to moment, between dictator and serf. McCarthys coached for other IFL teams and various college squads, and when the team is on defense, hes in his element. (Defensive play calls are not subject to the whims of Screaming Eagles rooters; theres no time for fans to call defensive plays in reaction to the other teams formation.) When his quarterback goes under center, though, he is suddenly, and very awkwardly, rendered powerless. He simply stares at a screen to see which play has been chosen, relays this info through his radio mic to the quarterbacks in-helmet earphone, and then prays that the wisdom of crowds applies to the gridiron. The coach can tweak around the edges. For instance, were fans to call the same play three consecutive times, he might disguise it by varying the pre-snap motion of the receivers. In the final minute of the half or the game, hes also permitted to seize control with a hurry-up offense that neednt wait for fan input. And, before the game begins, McCarthy helps choose the fans menu of possible plays, in concert with the app designers and the teams analytics chief (a former private equity analyst brought in by Farudi). Various down-and-distance situations each get buckets of plays, any of which McCarthy would theoretically be comfortable calling in that context. If he wants to make halftime adjustments after noting the other sides weaknesses, he can ask the techies to ramp up how often fans will be offered the option of, say, a bubble screen Still, compared with the tyrannical status enjoyed by most football head coaches, theres a lot of passivity baked in to McCarthys role. And here one is tempted to muse on the risks of direct democracy and the perilous downsides of castrating expertise while empowering the unwashed masses.

Its a good bet that a fan collective will opt for a radically higher pass-run ratio than a professional football coach would.

He envisions it as a sports-tech playground, with sensors in the balls and cameras on the helmets. Whatever happens with the Screaming Eagles, or the fan-dominated IFL Farudi pines for, I do think the future of sports lies in here somewhere. The early mistakes will be corrected. Someone will surely figure this out. My bet is that this sort of interactivity will soon come to minor league baseball. The sport has lots of long breaks in the action that would make voting easy. Its also rife with crucial yet relatively noncomplex decisions like whether to pull a pitcher or to pinch-hit for a batter. Wouldnt you want to vote on something like that? For now, well just have to gawk at the Screaming Eagles and their noble mission. A team of the fans, by the fans, for the fans. Theres hope for democracy, yet."","""
James Mann on why Michael Flynn flamed out faster than expected.,""":""The resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn this week was a stunning development, even for an administration that has generated more chaos and upheaval than Washington has ever seen in the early weeks of a presidency. With breaking news arriving nearly every hour, and with American foreign policy in an uncertain state, I spoke on the phone with James Mann, a journalist, expert on foreign affairs, and author of The Obamians: The Struggle Inside the White House to Redefine American Power. During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed what made Flynn such a unique national security adviser, whether the deep state is trying to undermine Trump, and the most boring part of the presidents job. Isaac Chotiner: You wrote a piece for the New York Times in December arguing that Trumps foreign policy team was built to fail. What has surprised even you about the past month? James Mann: I have been surprised by the intensity of the fights over Flynn, and I have been surprised at what it produced within the administration, which is to say: intense skirmishing among high-level people at the White House. To be self-critical about that piece, probably what I had more in mind and sketched out was a clash between Flynn and the secretary of defense, James Mattis. How different was Flynns brief tenure compared with people who have held his job? Usually what happens is that a president-elect, early on, designates a national security adviser who then begins a fairly orderly process of putting together a staff. And actually, Flynn followed some of these precedents, staffing out a National Security Council. It was different in that it was heavily dominated by people from the military. But there were also three things that were different about Flynn. The first was an intense regional focus on the Middle East and ISIS and terrorism. Flynn had no particular experience in dealing with other parts of American foreign policy or national security. Lets remember that Flynns development of ties with Russia came from his efforts to work with Russia on the Middle East. Even Russia was seen through a Middle Eastern focus. That is very unusual, for a national security adviser to be that focused in a way that everything else is seen through that lens. He has Muslims on the brain. Yes. [Laughs.] The second was a bureaucratic animus. He had it in for the regular intelligence community. Whatever grievances he had, he wore them on his sleeve. There were two different grievances. One was in favor of the guys in field versus the people in Washington, and the other grievance was against the CIA. Those are old fights, and a national security adviser doesnt usually bring those to his new job. The third is the matter of temperament, which isnt totally unrelated to the bureaucratic animus. This is a guy who exuded anger in a way that past national security advisers didnt. And fourth, I would add, is an almost cheerleader quality for the president-elect. There is really no precedent I can think of for a national security adviser having stood up at a political convention and suggesting that the opposing candidate should be locked up. One of the surprises is that all of this is taking place without all that much input from the secretaries of state and defense. This is really a very narrow bureaucratic battle in which two or three of the leading figures in the bureaucracy seem to play little of a role. What I am used to, much more often, is a full-scale, all-out war between the leading Cabinet secretaries, which was true in the Reagan administration and under George W. Bush. Or a battle between the national security and the online policy makers. What do you mean by that? Meaning the people carrying out the policy with China or Russia day to day. Whats amazing is that Flynn never got to the questions that should have hit him about how operational he should beshould he be in what is normally called the Brent Scowcroft model, where the national security adviser is sort of the arbiter? As an aside, even Scowcroft didnt follow that model, but it is the ideal that often gets put out there. When have national security advisers departed from that ideal? The first national security adviser to really break that mold was [Henry] Kissinger. In my mind, the single moment that was the most humiliating that you could possibly imagine for a secretary of state came as Kissinger was leaving on his secret trip to China, and they hadnt even told Secretary of State [William] Rogers that he was going. First they told him a lie, which was that this came up quickly as he was leaving for Pakistan. Then someone felt guilty, and they sent Kissingers deputy, who was Alexander Haig, to inform Rogers that, oh yeah, Kissinger has been negotiating with the Chinese, and has also been conducting secret talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris, and talks on arms control. Were you surprised by the amount of opposition Flynn and the president have faced from the bureaucracy? I guess I am not all that surprised. It would be one thing if Trump was just trying to change policy, but he is trying to change policy while belittling the motives and sincerity and patriotism of everyone before him. Flynn and Trump were impugning the motives of the entire U.S. intelligence community, and in the case of Flynn, he was telling untruths, which people in the intelligence community had access to. And they had legitimate access to it. I cant believe the back-and-forth about monitoring these phone conversations. They werent monitoring Flynn; they were monitoring the Russian ambassador. And above all, you had the perception that Flynns untruths might be, in the view of some in the intelligence community, betraying the interests of the United States to an adversary. Does the extent of the leaks worry you? People are using phrases like deep-state coup. I find those fears overblown. This is a unique case in which someone at the level of the national security adviser was saying things that were not true about his conversations with the government of one of the United States two leading adversaries in the world. The fact that people within the bureaucracy wanted to come outI dont see that as all that worrisome. I certainly dont see it as something like a deep-state coup, in your words. How likely is it that Trump will make a major effort to staff multiple levels of the bureaucracy with allies, and how possible is that for him to pull off? I think he is going to try. I think that is possible, if he is willing to find people who are willing to deal with Congress and the press and other governments in something other than an angry andconspiratorial way. Anything lower down requires experience with policy areas, whether its a country or region or an area like proliferation or counterterrorism. Most of the people in those policy areas have a body of knowledge, which Trump seems to mistrust. If there is a resentment of all expertise, then it is hard to get experts. Why cant he staff these positions with Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon types? The problem is that those nonexperts are going to have trouble winning support from the congressional committees, which know a little bit about the areas they are working on; from foreign governments that may know about the Middle East or Asia a little more; from journalists who cover particular areas. You wont have a policy if you dont have people who can draw up a policy. Along the lines of what you were saying earlier, its interesting that the person tapped to be the next national security adviser, Robert Harward, is supposed to be very close to Mattis. Exactly, yes. Maybe things will start running more smoothly. It could hardly run less smoothly. Let me add on that: By the natural order of things, foreign policy is still moving forward. It has to. Like with [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abes visit last weekend, you can envision a scenariomaybe for good reasons, more likely for ego reasonswhere Trump begins to like having foreign leaders come either as supplicants or bringing money and investment. He might get into at least the summit aspect of it. You can envision things settling down and that he might somehow get some pleasure out of the routine aspects of high-level diplomacy. On the other side of that, and I have heard this from Obama officials and in general, a good part of a presidents job is going to high-level multilateral meetings. There is a wonderful anecdote where during the Trump-Obama meeting, Obama just said he was going to go to APEC [the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum], and Trump asked what it was. Obama described it, and Trump said, That sounds boring. And in fact some of those meetings are. Obama himself used to get annoyed at some of those meetings he had to sit through, with four hours of speeches, while his top aides went off into bilateral meetings on topics that might be more interesting. He would be left there. Its not clear to me how [Trump] is going to get out of those, but I dont see him sitting through long meetings. But I can see him enjoying, eventually, well, I dont know. None of us really know, unfortunately. [Laughs.] Yeah."","""
"The Salt Lake Screaming Eagles, a football team controlled by fans with smartphones. ",""":""In a drafty arena on the outskirts of Salt Lake City, near the end of a full-pads training camp practice for an expansion, eight-on-eight indoor football team, I think I may have witnessed the future of sports. It wasnt a 470-pound tight end with a 9-foot vertical and a 3.2 40, or a genius new spread formation that aligns the center behind the tailback. It was just a few dudes with an app and a dream who, if all goes to plan, could fuse the gap between live sports, massive multiplayer videogames, and fantasy geek analytics. They are the minds behind the Salt Lake Screaming Eaglesthe newest franchise in the 10-team Indoor Football League, where tickets start at $5 and players make $250 a gameand theyre embarking on the first steps of a seasonlong experiment in what is being termed interactive football. A couple weeks ago, a few rows up in the near-deserted stands of the Maverik Centera minor-league hockey rink where the Screaming Eagles will play their home gamesI watched a dozen or so nonathletic folks in jeans and parkas thumb their iPhones and Android devices. Theyd been waiting for a scrimmage at the close of practice to run a live beta test, and now showtime had arrived. OK, pick your play! shouted a man in a hoodie sitting in the hockey penalty box, glancing at a laptop screen. Using the play-calling function on the Screaming Eagles mobile app, this test groupcomprising team owners, employees, and a few palsscrolled through diagrammed play selections, not unlike the kind youd see while playing a Madden NFL video game. Each voted for his or her favorite run or pass. Meanwhile, down on the sideline, the Screaming Eagles burly, bearded head coach stared at a separate laptop, impatiently awaiting the results. Once the leading vote-getter locked in (in this maiden effort, the winning play was a simple curl route), the coach barked the call to his quarterback as the 25-second play clock ticked. The QB broke the huddle, sprinted to the line of scrimmage, andhaving been issued marching orders by the people in the seatscompleted a curl to a receiver who was tackled for a short gain. Not much to look at, footballwise. The players still seemed wary. But shouts and cheers exploded from the stands, with phones raised triumphantly in the air. Then noses immediately returned to screens. No time to gloatthe coach and QB were antsy, peering upward, waiting for the fans next call as the play clock ticked down again. It didnt take long before the Screaming Eagles offense had driven the length of the fieldin the IFL, its just 50 yards from end zone to end zoneand punched the ball in for a touchdown. I voted for that play! laughed a hefty guy in a baseball hat. That was my play! You called that? Great call! shouted one of the Screaming Eagles players, pointing up into the seats. Sohrob Farudi, the teams majority owner, looked on with a wide, almost disbelieving grin. This is exactly what we wanted, he marveled. The players thanking the fans for calling their number! This is just how we dreamt it. * * * Farudi is a 39-year-old Los Angeles entrepreneur who, back in 2011, sold a company called Flipswap that hed built around a real-time pricing engine for used mobile phones. Although he didnt clear enough to fulfill his childhood dream of buying the Cowboys, in 2014 he did become a minority owner of the Arena Football Leagues Las Vegas Outlaws. That was the worst experience of my life, he says now. His six-figure investment resulted in a still-ongoing lawsuit and a bitter public feud with co-investor Vince Neilbetter known as the bleach-tressed lead vocalist of hair-metal rockers Mtley Cre. The Outlaws went kaput after a single season. Farudi vowed to try football ownership again, but this time he had a far bolder idea in mind. He longed to wed sports with mobile technology to somehow create a team that was completely interactiverun entirely by its fans. He found a few other folks entranced by the idea, formed an ownership group, and went hunting for a team to mess with. They settled on the IFL, which had been formed in 2008, because it let them start with a blank slate by buying the right to launch an expansion franchise. And so, in October 2015, Farudis group plunked down the $75,000 fee. And the wackadoo experimentation began. When Farudi said he wanted the franchise to be run entirely by its fans, he meant that he wanted the franchise to be run entirely by its fans. He started by putting the new teams geographic location up for a vote. Both Oklahoma City and Salt Lake were viable options, hed determined, so he put up a poll on the teams website. Once Salt Lake won, he asked the public to bestow a nickname on the team. About 36,000 votes came in, with Screaming Eagles beating out options like Teamy McTeamface and Spaghetti Monsters. Farudi says he was actually disappointed in the conservatism of the online hordes. He was rooting for a more offbeat choice to win because it would garner easy publicity, plus offer early proof that hed respect the fans wishes no matter how unconventional. Farudis a bit unconventional himself. His main business ventures currently include a wholesale marijuana edibles startup and an outfit that sells specialty cooking charcoal to restaurants. Hes young and clever, bored by the thought of running a regular old team, and absolutely tickled by the notion of introducing something wholly new to the world of sports. Guided by his thirst for novelty, he kept pushing forward, searching for more things that fans could vote on. Screaming Eagles partisans chose the head coach, based on a selection of rsums and some interviews the team uploaded to YouTube. Fans chose a portion of the players on the roster, based on college stats and footage from training camp practices. For a small fee, Farudi let folks dial into a weekly conference call, giving input directly to the teams president as virtual general managers. But his driving vision has always been to let the fans call plays. Farudi didnt want this to be a one-time gimmick, like voting on whether to receive or defer on the coin flip or letting a local celebrity call pass or run on the first snap after kickoff. He was determined to allow regular fans to choose every offensive play, in every possession, all game long. Hed also try to give them final say on any other in-game decision that could feasibly be put to a vote. Boot the next kickoff deep or attempt to onside it? Kick the extra point or go for two? Everything was fair game. Farudi was convinced he could make it work, technologywise. Certainly the fans in the arena could watch the game live and make quick play selections on their phones, choosing between a few tailored options. In the training camp session I watched, spectators got 15 seconds to lock in their picks, which left 10 seconds on the play clock for the offense to get to the line and hike. Sure enough, after initial hiccups, the team fell into a rhythm and had little problem executing the beamed-in calls.

Whatever happens with the Screaming Eagles, or the fan-dominated IFL Farudi pines for, I do think the future of sports lies in here somewhere. The early mistakes will be corrected. Someone will surely figure this out. My bet is that this sort of interactivity will soon come to minor league baseball. The sport has lots of long breaks in the action that would make voting easy. Its also rife with crucial yet relatively noncomplex decisions like whether to pull a pitcher or to pinch-hit for a batter. Wouldnt you want to vote on something like that? For now, well just have to gawk at the Screaming Eagles and their noble mission. A team of the fans, by the fans, for the fans. Theres hope for democracy, yet."","""
ICEs crackdown is beyond aggressive. Its illegal. ,""":""Since Donald Trump entered office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have cracked down on undocumented immigrants, conducting coordinated raids that appear to target not only convicted criminals but also individuals whose sole crime is living in the United States without documentation. This enforcement surge marks a departure from Obama-era restrictions, which limited the agencys enforcement priorities to convicts, terrorist threats, and people who recently crossed the bordera policy ICE openly despised. ICE is legally empowered to conduct sweeps, and Trump is within his rights to lift Obamas restrictions. But two recent high-profile arrests suggest that ICE may be altering evidence and manipulating facts in order to move in this aggressive new direction. Consider first the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, whom ICE agents arrested last Friday. Ramirez is a beneficiary of Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which allowed him to remain in the U.S. and work lawfully despite being undocumented. When he explained to ICE agents that he was legally here and showed them his DACA work permit, they detained him anyway. At a processing center, Ramirez reiterated that he had a lawful work permit. It doesnt matter, an agent responded, according a lawsuit filed on Ramirezs behalf, because you werent born in this country. After detaining him, ICE found a justification for his deportation, alleging that he was a self-admitted gang member. Its evidence for this allegation centered around an appeal that Ramirez wrote after arriving at the detention center requesting to be removed from its gang unit. The government said it included the line, I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform. But on Thursday, the Stranger published a photograph of the appealand it clearly shows that Ramirez had written in pencil: I came in and the officers said I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform. I do not have a criminal history and Im not affiliated with any gangs. Ramirezs lawyers allege that ICE officials doctored the document to prove that he belonged to a gang. The words I came in and the officers said were clearly erased so that the statement began with the statement I have gang affiliation. What began, I thought, as a mistake in bringing Daniel in has turned into a bogus operation that is attempting to railroad him and violate the sacred program that the DACA represents, his lawyer, Mark Rosenbaum, said on a press call. It is one of the most serious examples of governmental misconduct that I have come across in my 40 years of practice. Next, consider the troubling arrest of an undocumented domestic violence victim in El Paso, Texas, last week. County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal told the El Paso Times that ICE agents arrested the victim, a transgender woman, inside the courthouse shortly after she received a protective order against her alleged abuser. Bernal called the decision to make an arrest inside a protective court unprecedented. She added that ICE was likely acting on a tip from the victims alleged abuser, who may have been seeking vengeance. Eyewitnessesincluding lawyers from the county attorneys office, the judge who granted the protective order, and the victims advocateconfirmed Bernals account. An ICE affidavit told a very different story. According to that affidavit, ICE approached the woman only after she had exited the courthouse and proceeded to walk along the side walk. At that point, the affidavit states, agents questioned and arrested her. On Thursday, KFOX14 published surveillance video from the courthouse that seems to directly contradict the ICE affidavit. The footage appears to show ICE agents approaching the victim inside the courthouse and escorting her out of the building. That, of course, aligns with what multiple eyewitnesses, including county officials present at the courthouse, claim to have seenand suggests that the ICE affidavit was false. Thus far, ICE has declined to comment on the incident and has insisted that its recent raids have been mostly business as usual. ICE isnt the only government agency to face accusations of legal and ethical reaches: When Customs and Border Protection officers were given orders to implement Trumps Muslim ban, many did so with startling cruelty, then allegedly refused to comply with court rulings ordering them to stop. ICE agents seem to be taking a page from CBPs book, bending and even breaking the law in order to punish undocumented immigrants. Both abuses of power spring from Trumps insistence that his administration should do whatever it must to put America first. And both suggest that to Trump, federal agents neednt comply with law and order when might and mendacity will suffice."","""
Was Trump warned that Michael Flynn misled the FBI?,""":""Did Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, warn White House Counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26 that National Security Adviser Mike Flynn had misled the FBI? Did McGahn relay that warning to President Trump? And did Trump decide it wasnt legally problematic or serious enough to oust Flynn? That sequence needs to be investigated now that the Washington Post has disclosed what Flynn apparently told the FBI. Heres the basic story. On Dec. 29, Flynn had a phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. According to U.S. intercepts of the call, Flynn told Kislyak that the incoming Trump administration would review sanctions that had just been imposed on Russia by the Obama administration for interfering in the election that installed Trump. Two weeks after the call, around Jan. 13 or 14, Flynn told the White House that he and Kislyak hadnt talked about the sanctions. Based on this misinformation, Vice President Mike Pence and White House press secretary Sean Spicer publicly denied that the sanctions had been discussed. Intelligence and FBI officials had seen a secret report on the intercepts of the call. They knew Flynn had misled Pence and Spicer. They wanted to warn the White House. They had three concerns. One was that Flynns offer to review the sanctions might have violated the Logan Act, an old law that prohibits private citizens (which Flynn was at the time) from meddling in diplomacy. A second concern was that Russia could blackmail Flynn, since it knew the story he had told Pence was false. A third concern was that Pence needed to know he was being deceived. But that wasnt enough for FBI Director James Comey. According to a Washington Post report from Tuesday, Comey told Yates, CIA Director John Brennan, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that before they alerted the White House, they needed something more: On Obamas last full day in office, Jan.19, Clapper and Brennan made the case to Comey for informing the Trump team about Flynn. The FBI director pushed back primarily on the grounds that notifying the new administration could complicate the agencys investigation. The bureau, Comey also insisted, shouldnt be the truth police, according to an official familiar with his thinking at the time. In other words, if theres not a violation of law here, its not our job to go and tell the vice president that hes been lied to. In the days following Trumps inauguration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his calls with Kislyak. That removed the basis for Comeys earlier objection to notifying the White House, current and former officials said. It is unclear whether Flynn gave the agents an accurate account of his calls with Kislyak. If not, officials said he could find himself in serious legal jeopardy. The implication of these two paragraphs seems clear: The FBI interviewed Flynn on Jan. 24 to meet Comeys standard. The interview produced the requisite violation of the law. The Posts Thursday update indicates that the violation was Flynns false denial. The Post notes that Flynn followed his denial to the FBI by saying he couldnt recall all of the conversation, and a CNN report posted Friday morning says that after the agents challenged Flynn, he said he didnt remember. The FBI decided the interview wasnt enough of a basis to prosecute Flynn. But according to both CNN and the Post, it was enough to satisfy Comey that Yates could warn the White House. So she did. According to a Tuesday briefing by Spicer, on Jan. 26 Yates informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a heads up to us about Flynns deception. The Post reported that Yates warning to McGahn included something Spicer didnt mention in his Tuesday briefing: the danger that Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Its not clear what Yates told McGahn, if anything, about the FBI interview. Maybe, to protect the Flynn investigation, she didnt mention it. But it would be odd to delay warning the White House for lack of a crime, then send agents to interview Flynn to produce that crime, and then not mention or at least allude to that crime in the warning. Spicer says that at the time, Yates could not confirm there was an investigation. That remark by Spicer suggests that Yates withheld explicit confirmation but that something in her words made McGahn suspect Flynn was in legal trouble with the FBI and that the bureau had begun taking its usual steps, which would include an interview. If McGahn knew or suspected that the FBI had interviewed Flynn, the next question is what McGahn told Trump. According to Spicers account, McGahn briefed Trump and his senior advisers immediately (not including Pence, apparently) and, at Trumps direction, undertook an extensive review that included studying materials and interrogating Flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided. Spicer acknowledged that as part of this process, there was communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsels Office. But he refused to say what that entailed. The bottom line, said Spicer, was that Trump concluded Gen. Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsels review corroborated that. At his press conference Thursday, Trump said nothing he had heard from McGahn made him think Flynn was guilty of more than misleading Pence. Trump recalled that the information had come from Yates, the acting attorney general, and that I was a little surprised, because I said, Doesnt sound like he did anything wrong.  Trump was asked whether the White House had looked at transcripts of the intercepts or other evidence, but he didnt answer. When a reporter asked why Trump had kept Pence in the dark about McGahns information for nearly two weeks, Trump replied: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I dont think he [Flynn] did anything wrong.  Somewhere in this chain of events, something went horribly wrong. One possibility is that Yates, having secured Comeys approval to brief McGahn based on Flynns false statements to the FBI agents, didnt mention those statements to McGahn. Another possibility is that McGahn, having received at least a strong signal from Yates that Flynn had misled the FBI, didnt tell Trump. A third possibility is that McGahn told Trump, and Trump didnt care. One of these scenarios must be true. To find out, we need to put these people, and perhaps those around them, under oath."","""
